Hey there, welcome to our About Us page! I'm [Robby Aprianto](https://linkedin.com/in/robebeye), and I've been tinkering with tech since my university days at Universitas Teknologi Digital Indonesia Yogyakarta, where I graduated back in 2017. After that, I dived straight into the industry, gaining experience at a couple of companies before landing at Huawei in 2020.

At Huawei, I've had the opportunity to really flex my skills as a system engineer. From designing and implementing solutions to troubleshooting and maintenance, it's been a wild ride, and I've loved every minute of it. But let's rewind a bit - before Huawei, I cut my teeth at a couple of other tech firms, learning the ropes and getting a taste for what makes this industry tick.

Here at Huawei Systems Engineering Services, we're all about keeping things fresh and staying on the cutting edge. Whether it's optimizing networks, beefing up security, or diving into the cloud, we're here to help businesses thrive in the digital age. So, if you're looking for top-notch tech solutions with a personal touch, you're in the right place. Let's make some magic happen together!
